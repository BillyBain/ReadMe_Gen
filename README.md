# ReadMe Generator

This week I was tasked with making a ReadMe Generator using Node.js.
This genorator asks a series of questions to fill out the file.

My favorite part of this was learning how to format the Readme to function the way I intended it too!
I had a lot of help from this github page:https://github.com/fefong/markdown_readme

I did struggle a bit with putting the license part on the ReadMe.
I found a way to make it work though I feel there is a cleaner way to do it.

My walkthrough video for this project is here: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/oxQznoOm5cttwiXt0pUh

I also have an example in the test folder so you can examine what the code produces!
